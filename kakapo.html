            <p id="info-para">Kakapo also known as the Owl Parrot (Scientifically named Strigops habroptilus) is a multicellular organism (prokaryotic cells). They can be found at forests, scrubs, herb fields and tussock grasslands. They luckily are not extinct, but they are endangered, because the food they eat was not abundantly available in their habitat. Fun fact, it is the only flightless bird that lives. Their short wings are for balance and support rather than flying. It shows all characteristics of MRS.GREN. They Move with a jog-like gait. They climb tall trees using their beak and use their wings to help parachute to the floor. It Respires through air sacs that pump and store air through stationery lungs. Unlike animals, air gets stored in only one direction through kakapo lungs. With these air sacs,<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR46pxvW_5MWCa3PUoemjDUlh6-haETiUeYKbBY1SWFGzfhmq4tDTyAdGQoRKtMnLC9EdI&usqp=CAU" align="right"/> the birds have the ability to take in oxygen while exhaling. They can breathe at much higher escalations than animals because of their long structure. Next we talk about sensitivity. It has a well developed sense of smell, which adds to it's nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odurs while foraging. Next we talk about growth. They grow their feathers as they grow up. Next is reproduction. Female kakapo lays 1-4 eggs per their breeding cycle with several days between hatching eggs. Like all other birds, she nests on the ground to protect her eggs. Their hatchlings look like this (left image): <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Kakapo_chicks.jpg/440px-Kakapo_chicks.jpg" align="left"> They excrete like reptiles, their kidneys extract waste from their bloodstream and they release it in the form of uric acid, instead of our wate products (urea and ammonia) through the ureters and into the intestine. On nutrition's side of things, these kakapos are herbivores. So, they eat their native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and surprisingly even sapwood of the trees. The organism is important for out terrestrial ecosystem because it is the only flightless and nocturnal parrot, and it is the heaviest bird in the world with a weight of 3.5kg (8lbs)
