                Thorny Dragon aka Thorny Lizard/ Thorny Devil (Scientific name Moloch horridus) is a eukaryotic cell organism (multicellular organism). They live in the arid scrublands and deserts of the interiors of the world. They are an endangered species because they are experiencing threat from predators and we humans save their eggs as they are in danger of predators attacking them. Cool fact, they are covered in spikes, which gives the name, and which makes the predator think twice before swallowing a thorny dragon. It shows all 7 characteristics of MRS. GREN. Movement, tail lifted, they walk along with slow, jerky movements to and fro. Respiration, using their lungs. For sensitivity, they look with their eyes, but also they use their hard sharp spines that dissuade attacks from predators making them difficult to swallow. Growth. It grows upto 21cm (8.3in) in total legnth (inclusive of tail). Reproduction. The female thorny devil lays a set of 3-10 eggs usually in the month of September and December. She puts these into a nesting burrow almost 30-31ft underground. Eggs usually hatch after 3-4 months.  Excretion happens from the underside of its body. Nutrition usually happens when they eat ants. It is important to terrestrial ecosystem because being ant-specialist predators really helps their community.
